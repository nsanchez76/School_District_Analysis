# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the PyCity Schools District Analysis

The purpose of this analyis is to address the concerns of the PyCity School Board. They have recently been made aware of potential academic dishonest at Thomas High School. The math and reading scores of the entire ninth grade are in question. The School Board would like to uphold testing standards. So, a plan is formed to remove the Thomas High School ninth grade math and reading scores and replace them with "NaN" values. When that is complete, the entire School District Analysis will be run again, excluding the Thomas High School ninth grade math and reading schores.

## Results
